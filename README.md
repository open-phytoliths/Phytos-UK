## What is this project about and why is it important?
Phytoliths are plant microfossils used world-wide to address a variety of questions in a variety of fields like archaeology, palaeoecology and palaeontology. 

We are currently scoping to gather information and ideas to begin working on a phytolith reference collection for the UK flora. 

This collection is of interest to archaeobotanists, palaeoecologists and palaeontologists as well as general plant scientists. The collection is going to be a born digitial collection and work with an open and FAIR data focus to make the resources and outputs created as accessible and sustainable as possible.


## What do we want to do?
Preparation for funding application and starting to build community for project:
**1. Research different project management systems for data and workspace platforms** to identify the right option for this collection.
  - Speak to researchers that have established these sorts of workspace platforms already in related disciplines.

**2. Speak to UK phytolith researchers** to find out: 
  - What data and collections already exist?
  - What work in this area is already ongoing?
  - What are researchers needs in terms of a digital platform?
  - What are researchers needs in terms of more reference collection?

**3. Get advice from research software engineer** group at Turing.

**4. Further consider funding options** - scope any other funding sources or links to grants that have been applied for.


## What does this project need?

We need UK Phytolith researchers and those in related fields that are interested in open reference collections.
